# UFOs
## Overview of Project
#### The purpose of this analysis is to use Javascript for data that Dana has and to manipulate the tables being created. This will be done by creating easy to use filters to help with searching information within Dana's website since there is a lot.

## Results
#### Within the webpage one can use the different filters to narrow the results to the smallest number, if any. Here there are 5 filters to use to narrow the search down. The filters include the "date" of the event, "city", "state", "country", and "shape" of the UFO that was seen. I used Norton, MA, USA as an example, as shown in the results there was only one event that occured.<img width="1457" alt="webpage_image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86431959/133172667-c544c446-1bfa-4d4c-8f1a-33e0e40614d2.png">

## Summary
#### One drawback within the new design is it does not seem to eye catching for a new audience. Two recommendations would be an option to upload ones own video(s) and/or image(s) of proof of the event and object. Another recommendation would be to include a section within the webpage for people to write about their encounters if they did not have videos and/or images.
